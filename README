Repo designed to make it easier to inteface with D-Wave's quantum annealers, 
both simulators and real Quantum Processing Units.

I would like for this project to eventually coexist with qanic. That is, to create
a single Hamiltonian object that can be D-wave annealed or numerically annealed. 
However, this is out of the question currently with time.
