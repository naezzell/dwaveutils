Repo designed to make it easier to inteface with D-Wave's quantum annealers, 
both simulators and real Quantum Processing Units. Currently working on some 
additional features to make it easier to submit custom problems and 
adding support with QuTip to run open-system numerical simulations of 
annealing to compare to D-Wave.
